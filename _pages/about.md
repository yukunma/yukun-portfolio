Hello, I’m an Economics Ph.D. candidate at Vanderbilt University. My research centers around **econometric theory** and its **practical applications**. Specifically, my interests lie in robust inference for clustered data, machine-learning and high-dimensional methods, as well as weak identification in IV regression.

I am on the **2023–24 Job Market** and will be available for interviews.
My job market paper focuses on identification-robust inference for the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) with high-dimensional covariates.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my research interests. Please feel free to contact me for R codes or any other questions about my projects.
