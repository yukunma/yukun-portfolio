Hello, I am Yukun Ma, a Ph.D. student in **econometrics** at Vanderbilt University. My research centers around econometric theory and its practical applications. Specifically, my interests lie in _robust inference_ for clustered data and dyadic data, as well as _machine-learning_ methods.

I am currently working on my job market paper, which focuses on identification-robust inference for the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) with high-dimensional covariates.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my research interests. Please feel free to contact me for R codes or any other questions about my projects.
