I received the Ph.D. degree in Economics from Vanderbilt University. My research centers around econometric theory and its practical applications. Specifically, my interests lie in robust inference for clustered data, machine-learning and high-dimensional methods, as well as weak identification in IV regression.

<!-- My [job market paper](https://www.yukunma.com/jmp/), entitled “Identification-Robust Inference for the LATE with High-Dimensional Covariates,” received the Best Student Paper Award at the 2023 Midwest Econometrics Group (MEG) Conference.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my research interests. Please feel free to contact me for R codes or any other questions about my projects. -->

I will join the University of Rochester as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics with a joint appointment in the Goergen Institute for Data Science in 2024.
