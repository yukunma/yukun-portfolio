Hello, I'm Yukun Ma, a PhD student in **econometrics** at _Vanderbilt University_. I'm passionate about developing and applying statistical methods to answer economic questions. My work includes time series analysis, panel data models, and machine learning methods in econometrics.

I received my bachelor's degree in physics from Nankai University and my master's degree in economics from Guanghua Management School, Peking University. I'm currently pursuing my doctoral degree at Vanderbilt University, where I'm working on cutting-edge research in econometrics.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my research interests. Please feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work and interests.
